# 舍梵偈RhythmBuddha

舍梵偈RhythmBuddha是一款将敲击木鱼与音游机制结合的AR游戏。灵感来自于日本音乐僧侣药师寺宽邦在livehouse举办的个人演唱会。

在药师寺宽邦人声鼎沸的演唱会上，有剃度出家的师父，有双手合十跟着念经的师兄，有手中拨动电子念珠的女孩。由此引发我对于真实与虚幻、现实与信仰的思考——事物无常而虚幻，现实世界中常有迷茫，有执着而无法实现的理想。困于现实，崇尚信仰。于是我有了开发一款AR游戏的念头，将当下流行的敲打木鱼、跪拜佛祖行为与节奏游戏结合，目标是让用户在游玩过程中获得精神洗礼、心灵解脱。

舍，空也；梵，净也；偈，颂也。“一切有为法，应作如是观。”不妨借助AR增强现实，建造跨越时空与信仰的桥梁，构架一方虚实交错之地。沦入其中，享受游戏，享受当下。

RhythmBuddha is an AR game that combines tapping wooden fish with rhythm gameplay.The inspiration for RhythmBuddha came from the Japanese musical monk Yakuji Kōhō's personal concert held in a live house.

At Yakuji Kōhō's lively concert, there were monks who had taken their vows, brothers with hands clasped in prayer reciting sutras, and girls manipulating electronic prayer beads. This made me think about the concepts of reality and illusion, as well as reality and faith—things are transient and illusory, and the real world is often filled with confusion, with unachievable ideals. Trapped in reality, people seek faith. So I had the idea of developing an AR game that combines the current trends of hitting wooden fish and bowing to Buddha with rhythm games, aiming to give players a spiritual baptism and inner liberation during gameplay.

"She" signifies emptiness; "Fan" denotes purity; "Ji" refers to a verse."All conditioned phenomena should be viewed in this way." It would be interesting to use augmented reality (AR) to build a bridge that spans time, space, and faith, creating a place where the virtual and real are intertwined. Dive into it, enjoy the game, and embrace the present moment.

# 前期方案
## 基本机制
节奏游戏：将敲击木鱼、跪拜佛祖与节奏游戏机制结合，玩家根据音乐的节拍，敲打木鱼。玩家在AR设备上看到虚拟的木鱼，然后根据音乐的提示，点击或敲打相应的节拍点。

AR交互：通过设备的摄像头，玩家可以在真实世界中看到虚拟的木鱼。设备上的提示会指导玩家何时敲打，可能通过颜色、闪烁或箭头等视觉提示。

游戏关卡设计：设定多个关卡，随着游戏进行逐渐增加难度，挑战玩家的反应速度和节奏感。

奖励机制：设计奖励系统，鼓励玩家完成挑战并提升技能。例如解锁新歌曲、佛祖形象的变化或者其他游戏内的虚拟奖励。

Rhythm Game: This game combines the mechanics of tapping wooden fish and bowing to Buddha with rhythm game elements. Players tap the wooden fish according to the rhythm of the music. Using AR devices, players see virtual wooden fish and tap or strike the corresponding beat points as indicated by the music.

AR Interaction: Through the device's camera, players can see virtual wooden fish in the real world. On-screen cues guide players on when to tap, using visual indicators like color changes, flashes, or arrows.

Game Level Design: The game features multiple levels with gradually increasing difficulty, challenging players' reflexes and sense of rhythm as they progress.

Reward System: The game has a reward system that encourages players to complete challenges and improve their skills. Rewards could include unlocking new songs, changes in the Buddha's appearance, or other in-game virtual prizes.

## 美术形象设计
佛祖形象：佛祖的形象以经典的佛教艺术风格为主，加以赛博科幻风。

木鱼设计：木鱼形象以佛教经典花纹为主，材质依据佛祖的材质效果决定。

动画效果：为佛祖设计动态效果，手持乐器，跟随音乐节奏一齐演奏。

Buddha Character Design: The Buddha's appearance primarily follows classic Buddhist art styles, with a touch of cyber-science fiction.

Wooden Fish Design: The wooden fish's design is inspired by traditional Buddhist patterns, and its material is determined by the Buddha's material effects.

Animation Effects: The Buddha has dynamic animations, playing an instrument in sync with the rhythm of the music.

## 选歌页面设计
界面布局：选歌页面包括歌曲列表、难度选择、游戏模式等功能。

界面视觉：以佛祖演奏乐器为背景，界面加以佛教经典花纹元素。

Interface Layout: The song selection screen includes features such as a song list, difficulty selection, and game modes.

Interface Visuals: The background features Buddha playing musical instruments, with the interface incorporating elements of traditional Buddhist patterns.

## 技术实现
音乐节奏分析：利用Unity插件Koreographer音频处理技术，分析音乐的节奏和节拍信息，使得佛珠准确落到音乐节拍上，用户敲击更有节律。

Music Rhythm Analysis: Using the Unity plugin Koreographer's audio processing technology, the game's music is analyzed for rhythm and beat information, ensuring that the prayer beads accurately align with the music's beats, allowing users to tap in a more rhythmic manner.

## 音乐和节奏互动
音乐感知：通过使用Koreographer，游戏可以分析歌曲的节奏、拍子和节奏变化，并以此设计游戏中的节奏事件，佛珠的产生可以恰好落到节拍上。

节奏挑战：玩家可以根据音乐的节奏进行敲击木鱼，若触碰飞来的佛珠，则触发木鱼缩放动画，实现对音乐节奏的互动。

Music Perception: By using Koreographer, the game can analyze the rhythm, beats, and tempo changes of a song to design rhythm events within the game, ensuring that the appearance of prayer beads aligns perfectly with the music's beats.

Rhythm Challenge: Players can tap the wooden fish in time with the music's rhythm. If they hit incoming prayer beads, a scaling animation is triggered, creating an interactive response to the musical rhythm.

## 图像识别与物体碰撞
图像识别：利用AR Tracked Object Manager指定生成物体Cube。

物体碰撞：Cube作为碰撞器触碰飞来的佛珠，以实现敲击即消除佛珠。玩家可以使用触控设备（木鱼槌）进行敲击操作，与游戏中的虚拟木鱼及佛珠互动。

Image Recognition: Use the AR Tracked Object Manager to specify a generated object Cube.

Object Collision: The Cube acts as a collider to interact with the incoming prayer beads, enabling their removal upon impact. Players can use a touch device (like a wooden fish mallet) to tap, interacting with the virtual wooden fish and prayer beads within the game.

## Holokit头显支持
使用Holokit SDK用于实现AR场景交互效果，佩戴Holokit头显即可将虚拟元素叠加在现实世界中，实现木鱼槌与虚拟木鱼互动。

The Holokit SDK is used to create AR scene interaction effects. By wearing a Holokit headset, virtual elements can be superimposed onto the real world, allowing interaction between the wooden fish mallet and the virtual wooden fish.
